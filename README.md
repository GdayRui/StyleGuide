## Assumptions
Since the requirement/UI design didn't mention how and where to display the sample code, therefore below assumptions are made
- A button is added under the tabs to toggle the display of the sample code area.
- The sample code area is located under the toggle button.
- The toggle button and the sample code area can be applied to all other component once the design is refined.
